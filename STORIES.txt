Fren is the 16-year old only daughter of laborer Jeb.
She met a boy named Terrence who is affiliated with the Rise, and has designs on joining herself.
To make ends meet, she collects old mecha parts at the Ancient Junkyard unbeknownst to her father,
and sells them to a shadowy stranger she meets at the Abandoned Trade Post on Slime Corner for coin.
She's rather tech-savvy, and sometimes cobbles together devices to keep for herself, like her Mech-Eye Flasher
and her Spark Knife.
