History vs. Log vs. SenseLog???

Marks should not be an Engram.

Fucking verbs.. how does validity get re-evaluated when target state changes? other state? if something despawns?
Show verbs of Agents when inspecting.
 * Immediate (attacking, moving)
 * Task (trying to kill you, traveling home)
 * Goal (defending the city, looking for a magic necklace)

No-Travel zones for agents
Homes?

Make CharacterStreams RNG, Location Stream RNG, for the various levels of procgen so for example
a mustache doesn't change the entire western hemisphere.

diplomacy 1d6
resist. 2
suspicious +2 resist vs. diplomacy.
When you roll diplomacy, reduce will (blue hearts?). after X times (patience - bar with discrete segments, regens but very slowly)
If you reduce will to 0, you gain: the shtuff.

LOCALES:
	* Places to go while agents are relaxing.
	The Neon Strip - engis lurk here, gaming parlours, etc.
	Bio Domes - farmers work here, commute from the 'burbs
	Flesh Road - for all that stuff.

BEHAVIOUR:
	* Should generating Behaviours use POtentialVerb set?  THere is some redundancy when specifying potential verbs via COllectVerbs, and having to manually add a Behaviour verb in the character def.  Having two requirements makes potential verbs inflexible.
	* Does the normal Behaviour AI run for the player, and the player simply *selects* what should be done?
	
	
	figure out how behaviours run in parallel without stepping on eachothers toes.
	* Think of behaviour as a 'fourier analysis'. Start with the basic 'spine' of
	the behaviour, the basest default, eg. "Diurnal".
	* Then layer on complexity, whose times/etc vary dpeending on agent state.
	* Not dissimilar to what we have now, biggest problem is figuring out the correct priority. I think priority
	is actually a vector; firstly time scale, and secondly importance. (how important is this behaviour is on the order of this time unit).  So for example, "running from enemy" is on the short time scale (seconds), and very improtant.  "obtaining the killswitch" is very important but on a large time scale.
	* behaviours are also dynamic:
		"Stay alive" isn't always there, it's only there under certain criteria/when certain things happen, like
		getting in combat.  Once out of combat, the behaviour removes itself.
	
	Are behaviours what we should have a DSL for?  Want to basically work in these units of game data.


DEBUG LOG FILE:
	pls.

SENSELOG:
	needs to keep parameters, not just text, to so newly learned identities change logs from the past.

AI/PLANNING:
Structuring Access to resources and planning relationships:
	track gain/loss of resources within Verbs for an agent for a week, say.
	agent becomes a sink or source of these.
	* relationships dictate a resource flow (specified in broad categories) that are permitted.
	* a well-connected agent has broad access to sinks or sources as the need may be, and then
	wish to construct a particular relationsihp with the target.
	* An given agent has paritcular Verbs avilaalbe for constructing these relationships.
	* A given agent might even have a relationship (subordinate) who's job is to construct these relationships for him.

You have max token slots, and tokens in them.  You commit them to certain requirement sets (embedded in social Interactions, etc.), which typically unlocks something.

Diplo 1 can unlock lvl 1. Acquintances, who will reveal knowledge.

Knowledge gains you xp.

When you sleep, you convert XP to charge your stats.  (See punch club.)  When stats exceed a level, you can add a token, upgrade a token, roll for a token, etc.  Stat drain is locked in at integers (won't drain past a level).

Stats drain over time, and take increasingly more XP to increase.

You must find where your tokens best fit to optimize for XP gain in a cycle of growth.


INFO MODEL:
	Add verbs for utilizing certain info.
	LOCAL_NEWS:
		Event model for tracking newsworthy events within a region?
		Somehow, local news lets you learn about 'public aspects' of people.
